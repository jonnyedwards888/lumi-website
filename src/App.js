            "I conceived ReMeLife as a response to my own family experiences, of my time spent developing apps in the care sector, and of the obvious potential of AI, blockchain and crypto to be able to support the financial needs of those that are simply not benefitting from the fiat value inherent in their own digital daily care. Lumi is the all critical element that is integrating the power of AI into the ecosystem, and that will manage scale and data, and drive consumer engagement through his meme character.

          <p className="mt-8 text-lg text-center" style={{ fontFamily: 'Space Grotesk, Orbitron, sans-serif' }}>
            As a decentralised, tech-based community ecosystem, Lumi assists combat today's unfair harvesting of our daily care actions. As the rich get richer and the rest of us lose our rights and opportunities, Lumi is very much needed, as we enter a new era. We hope you will join us in this mission".

      answer: `<p>The world is changing and crypto, CBDC's, digital currency, the metaverse, etc., are coming, so you will need to learn the ropes anyway, when it comes to digital wallets, payment transfers, digital money interfaces, etc. So, it makes sense to be ahead of the game.</p><p>And there are opportunities to be had along the way that others are profiting from, not to mention some fun and means to support those social impact projects that you support, which in our case is carers and those being cared for.</p>`

      question: "IS BUYING CRYPTO AND LUMI RISKY?",
      answer: `<p>Yes, absolutely. Just as betting on the horses, or the stock market, carry their own level of risk, so does buying a token, meme or otherwise on an exchange.</p><p>Indeed, meme tokens are highly volatile and should be considered risky, even true utility, actual project based tokens such as $LUMI.</p>`

      answer: `<p>We get asked this a lot, for ReMeLife, which is the world's first Web3 healthcare platform, has a lot to offer and can seem complicated at first inspection.</p><p>But just like a car, that has a lot going on under the bonnet, however it's simple on the outside. And when you've learnt to use it, it becomes easy and fun. It's the same with ReMeLife.</p><p>For 65% of the world is caring for someone, and they use apps to support their care needs. But they get no financial benefit from the care work they perform with these apps, from the purchases they make online or from the data they generate daily. By using ReMeLife's apps, Members gain REME tokens for their care actions, for posting in the forum, purchasing products, sharing content with their care circle and for sharing their data.</p><p>ReMeLife is the world's first rewards-based healthcare platform.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

Note that where the Information is held by a third party data controller, such as an advertising partner or a payment processor, we will use reasonable steps to inform them of your request, but we recommend you contact them directly in accordance with their own privacy policies to ensure your personal data is erased.

Objection and withdrawal of consent: You have the right to (i) withdraw your consent where you previously provided such consent; or (ii) object to our processing of your Information where we process such Information on the basis of our legitimate interests (see How we use your personal information).

You should only purchase BLUI tokens if you fully understand the tokenomics as defined and the nature and intent of the BLUI meme token. Crypto assets can be subject to expropriation and theft. Computer hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may seek to interfere with the BLUI issuance in a number of different ways. These may include malware, tax, distributed denial of service attacks and consensus-based exploits, such as a 51% attack that could result in the loss of BLUI tokens or the loss of the ability to access BLUI tokens.
Because of the immutable nature of the blockchain transactions there may be no remedy if a successful attack by malicious actors was to take place against the ethereum chain that the BLUI smart contract is built on.
Crypto assets are not regulated as financial instruments and there is no refund or compensation available from regulatory bodies such as the UK's financial services compensation scheme and similar bodies in other jurisdictions. The regulatory status of crypto assets remains uncertain and varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, presenting owners of crypto assets with legal uncertainty. It is possible that in the future certain laws, regulations, policies, or rules relating to crypto assets, blockchain technology or decentralised applications may be implemented that affect or restrict token holders' acquisition, ownership rights, and their ability to buy, sell, convert, or use crypto assets such as the BLUI token.
Uncertainties regarding tax legislation relating to crypto assets could leave token holders exposed to unforeseen consequences such as taxable events retrospectively applied or to be applied in the future.
Each perspective BLUI purchaser should weigh up their own individual appetite for risk and consider consulting an independent financial adviser before making any decisions. Readers of this whitepaper may also need to consult a tax professional, accountant, lawyer, or other professionals in order to satisfy themselves regarding any outstanding matters related to how BLUIs are designed before deciding whether a purchase of BLUI tokens will be in line with their risk profile.
Crypto currencies may be unregulated in your jurisdiction. The value of cryptocurrencies may go down as well as up. Profits may be subject to capital gains or other taxes applicable in your jurisdiction.
