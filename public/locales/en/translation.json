    "faq1Answer": "<p>The world is changing and crypto, CBDC's, digital currency, the metaverse, etc., are coming, so you will need to learn the ropes anyway, when it comes to digital wallets, payment transfers, digital money interfaces, etc. So, it makes sense to be ahead of the game.</p><p>And there are opportunities to be had along the way that others are profiting from, not to mention some fun and means to support those social impact projects that you support, which in our case is carers and those being cared for.</p>",
    "faq2Question": "IS BUYING CRYPTO AND LUMI RISKY?",
    "faq2Answer": "<p>Yes, absolutely. Just as betting on the horses, or the stock market, carry their own level of risk, so does buying a token, meme or otherwise on an exchange.</p><p>Indeed, meme tokens are highly volatile and should be considered risky, even true utility, actual project based tokens such as $LUMI.</p>",
    "faq3Question": "DESCRIBE REMELIFE IN ONE PARAGRAPH",
    "faq3Answer": "<p>We get asked this a lot, for ReMeLife, which is the world's first Web3 healthcare platform, has a lot to offer and can seem complicated at first inspection.</p><p>But just like a car, that has a lot going on under the bonnet, however it's simple on the outside. And when you've learnt to use it, it becomes easy and fun. It's the same with ReMeLife.</p><p>For 65% of the world is caring for someone, and they use apps to support their care needs. But they get no financial benefit from the care work they perform with these apps, from the purchases they make online or from the data they generate daily. By using ReMeLife's apps, Members gain REME tokens for their care actions, for posting in the forum, purchasing products, sharing content with their care circle and for sharing their data.</p><p>ReMeLife is the world's first rewards-based healthcare platform. Simple.</p>"
